# Logging into AWS and setting up a VM
We will be using a bonafide AWS account set up for our class.  However, we will log into it via a process that allows UVA to manage users.
You will use your virginia email and password just as you do with all other UVA related resources.

## Loggign in via eservices:
* Navigate to `https://eservices-uva.awsapps.com/start/`
* You should see a familiar prompt(s) for your UVA signin.  Follow through with your ID and password.
* You should end up at the AWS UI
* Top left menu bar, make sure you are in the `virginia` data center
* Go to `EC2`
* From there, follow video instructions to set up your VM
* PLEASE stick to the naming conventions.  For security reasons, if I see a VM that doesn't match I will remove it.
