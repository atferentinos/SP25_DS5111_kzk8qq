# Logging into AWS and setting up a VM
We will be using a bonafide AWS account set up for our class.  However, we will log into it via a process that allows UVA to manage users.
You will use your virginia email and password just as you do with all other UVA related resources.

## Loggign in via eservices:
* Go to `https://eservices-uva.awsapps.com/start/` and once logged in they should see your account.
